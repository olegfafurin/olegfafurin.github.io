I'm a Computer Scientist with prior experience in Software Engineering, Quantitative Research and Competitive mathematics. Areas of my interest include Algorithms and Data Structures, Probabilistic Proofs and Discrete Mathematics. As I'm currently approaching the end of my Master studies I'm actively searching for a position in or in between Software Engineering, Quantitative Analysis and Applied Research either in Switzerland or in other parts of Europe.
